- beginning of meeting song 

-week strucutre
- having days in the begining

- wednes - half, half
- friday - 

no cheat sheet

what went well
- offer resources on the sunday 
- start off sunday with heavy explanation
- keep giving more rez
- be the admin of the repo and other resources to designate perms/access
- mindset, internal team help, shared ownership 
- breaks are encouraged!

Things to think about
- extend concepts as needed as topics increase complexity
- wednesday - split between content questions, pair programming
- potential to 2 week sprints

---

what didnt go well
- applying the knowledge didnt go well
- maybe too high level of examples and not focused enough on the granular details
- more live coding from instruction
- documentation too wide for focused section
- solo time detered - but first week we work on specific vocab, theroretical, follow along
	- second week - pair programming, applying concepts
- instructor might be getting asked too many questions at once
- more targeted examples that focus on a more simple version, that start out as a structured small example that can be built upon
- gotta get back on reading the output

what went well 
- solo time helped - makes you learn and have ownership, you learn to ask broader questions
- learning how to attack a small project
	- realization that we didnt ask for AC / Requirements from the business
- looking to learn code structure
- getting to something concrete boost morale, allows you  to expand more

Things to think about
- get to a working base quickly, dont code too much at once, test code often, remind the team with transparent comms
- during pair programming - waves of individual 15 min q&a
- the more reps, the easier it gets!

---

what didnt go well
- better communication outside of the meetings
- we only covered surface level of the 6 sections

what went well 
- not many things went wrong
- reviewing PRs helped teammates meet AC and reduce bugs proactively!!! very important
- troubleshooting / debugging errors or incorrect syntax or logic

Things to think about
- what to do when we're done early
	- dive deeper on surface level topic of the sprints
	- revisit old topics as well
- sprints - two weeks or maybe more depending on subject

---

what didnt go well
- never found intellisense
	- youtube - C# intellisense in VsCode
- need more examples as we cover more complex topics
	- starting week 2 of SPrint 2 -> 4 OOP Principles
- we can and WILL take more breaks
what went well
- early AC (Business meeting) thinking in terms of bring value to the biz
	- helps to start strong 
	- discussing AC and agreeing as a team
- psuedocode
	- helps structure your thoughts -> logic -> code
- good pacing
- building upon each lesson
	- git, command line interfcae
	- variables, types, arithmitic
	- functions, class
	- inheritance
things to think about
- more psuedocode
- break up thoughts, logic, conditionals, functions into small pieces that are managable
