Rocket has something of a rough around the edges attitude. Rocket is a brash, hot headed, snarky and trigger happy raccoon, it takes very little to set off his temper, being called a raccoon being one of them (which he is). He is also a bit of a kleptomaniac, often stealing things that he can get his paws on, including stuff from other heroes like Peni’s mech, Frank’s turret and so on. While it’s these traits that makes it difficult For Rocket to get along with others (Star-Lord included) and his status as a hero questionable, he is not without his perks, one of them being his rarely expressed kindness and care for his friends, including his closest friend, Groot. Rocket possesses a highly advanced knowledge of technology and a tactical mindset, often using those gifts in fixing up the ship or making a plan for any problems he and his team run into. Rocket’s source of his anger is from his past of being painfully experimented on, and it’s that pain that often leads him to push others away, so that he never feels that pain again.
